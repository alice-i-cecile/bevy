# Code of Conduct

_This Code of Conduct is based on the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct), which is adapted from the [Node.js Policy on Trolling](http://blog.izs.me/post/30036893703/policy-on-trolling) and the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org)._

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

In this community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don’t just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they’re off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.

And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could’ve communicated better — remember that it’s your responsibility to make others in the community comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.

* Please avoid using overtly sexual aliases or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
* Please be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude.
* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term “harassment” as including the definition in the [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md); if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don’t tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
* Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact the maintainers immediately. Whether you’re a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we’ve got your back.
* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding [our community’s standards of conduct](#our-standards). If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the maintainers.
The enforcement policies in the code of conduct apply to all official venues, including Discord channels, GitHub repositories, the Twitter community and all other forums.

1. Hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks are not allowed.
2. Remarks that maintainers find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.

When the standards are violated, maintainers will:

1. Warn the offender.
2. If a second warning would be needed (or the warning is not heeded), the offender is kicked, but may rejoin.
3. If bad behavior persists after rejoining, the offender will be permanently banned.

Maintainers are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a maintainer creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.
If you feel disciplinary action was unwarranted, please make a dedicated thread in #community on Discord to discuss it, or message the moderation team in private.
