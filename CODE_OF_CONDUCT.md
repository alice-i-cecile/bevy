# Code of Conduct

_This Code of Conduct is based on the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct), which is adapted from the [Node.js Policy on Trolling](http://blog.izs.me/post/30036893703/policy-on-trolling) and the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org)._

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

In this community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don’t just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they’re off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.

And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could’ve communicated better — remember that it’s your responsibility to make others in the community comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding [our community’s standards of conduct](#our-standards). If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the maintainers.
The enforcement policies in the code of conduct apply to all official venues, including Discord channels, GitHub repositories, the Twitter community and all other forums.

1. Hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks are not allowed.
2. Personal attacks are out-of-line: disagree with specific actions and decisions in a constructive way.
3. Nicknames or aliases that are offensive or overtly sexual are not allowed. You will be asked to change these.
4. Spamming, low-grade trolling and flame-baiting make the community worse and are not allowed.
5. Bevy is an all-ages community. This is not the place for explicitly sexual or gorey materials.

Maintainers are held to a higher standard than other community members.
If a maintainer violates community standards, they should expect less leeway than others.
These policies apply to private interactions between community members as well as those in public: if someone has been harassing you in private, let us know.

When the standards are violated, maintainers will:

1. Warn the offender.
2. If a second warning would be needed (or the warning is not heeded), the offender is kicked, but may rejoin after cooling off.
3. If bad behavior persists after rejoining, the offender will be permanently banned.
4. Spam bots will be banned on sight.
   1. If this was done in error (or if your account was hacked), message the maintainers to reverse the ban.

If you feel disciplinary action was unwarranted, please make a dedicated thread in #community on Discord to discuss it, or message the moderation team in private.
