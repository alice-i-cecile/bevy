## What inconsistency, frustration or unpleasant surprise did you encounter?

Try to be as clear as you can.
If this is part of a broader problem, include a specific example but feel free to point out other areas where this needs to be fixed.

If you have relevant code snippets or screenshots to help others reproduce the problem, put them here.

## How can we make this better?

What would an ideal solution look like?
Talk about your dream API, the error messages you wish you had, or that one method you desperately need.

## [Optional] Implementation strategy

If you know how to fix this, link to the relevant section of the code and describe how it should be changed.

If there are things preventing us from going straight to an ideal solution, mention them here.
