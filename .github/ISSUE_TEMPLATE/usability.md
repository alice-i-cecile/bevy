## What tripped you up?

Was something inconsistent, surprising or frustrating?
Try to provide specific examples if you can.
These could be code snippets, screenshots, a link to a bad error message in our source code, etc.

If this is part of a broader problem, feel free to point out other areas where this needs to be fixed.

## What would help you next time?

What would your ideal solution look like?
Talk about your dream API, the error messages you wish you had, or that one method you desperately need.

## \[Optional\] Implementation strategy

If you know how to fix this, link to the relevant section of the code and describe how it should be changed.

If there are things preventing us from going straight to an ideal solution, mention them here.
